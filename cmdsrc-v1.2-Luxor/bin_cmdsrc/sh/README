DNIX shell V. 0.01   1983-xx-xx

Departures from UNIX shell
==========================

-The commands 'english' och 'swedish' switch between
 UNIX and DNIX syntax.

-Process id for last background command is called $+ instead
 of $! to avoid confusion with the pipe symbol.

Departures from specification
=============================

- Shell variable substitutions are written as '$:...:' instead of
  '$(...)', because the parentheses are special characters,
  that terminate words.


UNIX syntax with DNIX syntax equivalents
========================================

{ command-list }		begin command-list end	(command groupers)
|				!			(pipe symbol)
||				!!			(OR symbol)
word | word			word ! word		(OR in pattern)
[...]				:...:			(parameter substitution)
`...`				#...#			(command substitution)
\				%			(quote next character)
